# Jobly
This is a project I have worked on for my CSE 311 course.
The website is called Jobly --  a joint venture for job recruitment and job hunting. 
There is a login page for both the recruiters and job seekers. 
A databse was created to handle all the user information. 
You can search for active job listings and even update your current job.
This was mainly a MySQL database based project, showcasing our database handling capabilites.
